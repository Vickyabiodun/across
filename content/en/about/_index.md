The <a href="https://vermontcomplexsystems.org/partner/OCEAN/">OCEAN (Open Source Complex Ecosystems and Networks) Project</a> stems from an unrestricted gift from the Google Open Source Programs Office to the Vermont Complex Systems Center.
Our research partners are using this gift to build a community-oriented body of research focused on understanding how open source platforms are used and what makes technology-rich environments thrive. 
ACROSS is a part of this work.

## Goals 

The ACROSS (Attributing Contributor Roles in Open Source Software) virtual workshops are designed to: 

* Bring folks together from an open source community to identify what kinds of work and activities create, sustain, and foster their project
* Help projects improve how they identify and recognize their contributor community
* Improve the overall visibility of the work needed to maintain open source communities

In these workshops we will walk you through a process to identify the work that is being done, then help you create or improve your existing documentation to make that work visible.
